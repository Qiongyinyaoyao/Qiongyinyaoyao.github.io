            <p> I always wanted to learn how to cut videos but I didn’t have a lot of free time. These days our school is on holiday and we don’t have any homework, so I can find some tutorials on the Internet to learn how to cut out a character in the film by myself. I edited a character with Premiere for the first time following the tutorial video. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/19/URaH7d.jpg" alt="URaH7d.jpg"></p>
<p> Premiere was a little easier to get started with than I thought, and It didn’t take me long to cut out the clips from the video. (I basically cut out the clips As I watched.) But it took me a long time to name them. In order to find the fragments I want in the future, I marked the movements, positions, facial expressions and colors of the characters in the fragments in detail</p>

            <p>Comments on Judy’s Unit 1 Session 1 Homework Dr Andrew Hunt                  April 2020</p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong></p>
<p>On one page of A4</p>
<p>Select 1 method of measuring businesses and define it.</p>
<p>Discuss how businesses in China could be measured using this method.</p>
<p>Show how this method can be used to measure business growth in China.</p>
<p>Include sources and references.</p>
<p><strong>To</strong> <strong>be submitted by 11 April 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>Content</p>
<p>·     Some of the key points including the discussion different types of growth, and how they can be used to measure businesses.</p>
<p>·     A few key elements were missing, such defining the measures of growth, and a clear conclusion were barely covered.</p>
<p>·     Overall the essay would probably be given a <strong>pass.</strong></p>
<p>Academic Writing</p>
<p>·     Need to clearly identify all pages of the essay. Each page should include at least your name (or student number), date of submission, Module or department.</p>
<p>·     There are few references in this essay. All key points, or potentially controversial statements, theories, statistics, and descriptions should be supported by references. Each reference can be used more than once in the essay to support relevant statements.</p>
<p>·     All citations in the essay text should include: Author surname, Year of publication, for example (Cook, 2017) Whereas, references should always take the form of Author surname, Year published, Title, Publisher. You also need to include a little more information in the citation for quotes: Author, Year, Page number.</p>
<p>·     In a few cases, the homework included the  personal (I, myself etc.). Academic essays are always in the third person.</p>
<p>English Language</p>
<p>·     Overall, the written English was acceptable. Although the objectiveness of academic English was sometimes lacking.</p>
<p>·     There were a few unclear or poor phrases and incomplete statements, which could cause confusion and lower marking.</p>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>·     Once the essay is complete, review it and check against the question, to ensure all elements have been clearly answered.</p>
<p>·     Ensure all essays include relevant citations (and references) wherever possible.</p>
<p>More detailed comments have been shown in the essay below [In Blue]</p>
<p>1 way1 of measuring business growth define it</p>
<p>如何用这种方法衡量中国企业</p>
<p>中国怎么用这种方法来测量经济增长 business growth</p>
<p>number of new business opening growth of share value of business</p>
<p>Each way to classify business can be used to measure business and business growth. Companies are classified by size, geographic location (whether local or national), and the industry in which they operate. Correspondingly, the business growth of a company can be seen from the change in the size of the company, the increase of the number of enterprises in a region within a year, and the increase of the number of enterprises engaged in an industry within a certain period of time. I would like to talk In this article, the author will mainly use the second method mentioned above to explain how to measure the business growth of Chinese enterprises by the increase of the number of companies in a region and how China measures the business growth by this method.(the economics course)</p>
<p>[An interesting introduction, discussing some of some ways in which business growth can be measured, and clearly stating the one you will use]</p>
<p>In fact, not only in China, but all over the world in a certain country or a city, the number of stores added to the same brand in one year can be used to effectively measure the business growth of the brand. According to the business previous financial statements and the estimated value of the company’s products, the company’s future revenue tends can be analyzed.</p>
<p>Take Luckin for example (The financial statements of Lukin were falsified in the third quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, I selected the quarterly results of the second quarter of 2019 for analysis，the trend in the data is generally accurate) [Not sure this is really relevant for this homework. But could be a usefull discussion in a longer essay.]</p>
<p>In terms of opening speed, Luckin has achieved its promised goal of having more than 4,500 stores nationwide by the end of 2019. By the second quarter of 2019, Luckin had 3,680 stores, up 209.5 percent from 189 stores in the second quarter of 2018, according to the results. Meanwhile, operating losses at Luckin’s  stores  in  the  quarter  was  RMB55.8  million  (US$8.1  million) ,decreasing from a loss of RMB 81.7million in the second quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>[This is good. You have used two measures of growth (Number of stores and Profit), as well as showing how a reduction in losses can be an indicator of profit.]</p>

<p>Although the overall daily line is still in the loss state, but with the opening of more stores, the loss compared with the previous quarter is significantly reduced.

Table turnover held up well in both new/existing stores at 4.1x/4.9x in FY 19( vs 4.5x/5.2x, in FY18). We believe canalization exists, but it is not very significant. Management is not confident that there is still room to grow as many cities(e.g. Beijing and Guangzhou) still have table turnover of above 5x, implying 2-3 hours waiting time during peak hours, which may bring adverse experience” (Growth is likely to resume in 2H20E,CMB</p>

<p>It is well known that the common measure of a country’s domestic business growth is gross domestic product. China’s GDP was 14.36 trillion dollars in 2019 ,which was 6.1% more than the year before【I don’t know exactly what data is appropriate to post here, because I don’t know what kind of data can prove that the growth of the number of stores can directly affect the growth of China’s GDP】China’s business growth can be measured by converting the annual sales revenue from news opened in China into corresponding GDP. [You have used the example of Lucin Coffee to clearly illustrate how businesses can grow. As such, there was no real need to discuss GDP It would have been better to provide a clear conclusion, discussing Luckin Coffee’s growt</p>

            <p>My homework and comments from the teacher</p>
<p>Comments on Judy’s Unit 1, Session 3 Homework </p>
<p>Dr Andrew Hunt  June 2020 </p>
<p>【requirement of the homework】</p>
<p>Homework </p>
<p>On one side of A4 paper </p>
<p> An electronics firm currently has a production choice between 10 smartphones or 4 </p>
<p>televisions. </p>
<p>❖ Calculate and show the production possibility curve. </p>
<p>❖ On 1 single A4 page. Discuss some of the ways that the electronics firm could increase the production possibility for these choices by 50%. </p>
<p> Submit by 30 May 2020 </p>
<p>【Homework】</p>
<p>Because there are finite limits to all the resources, the company has to make choice between making 10 smartphones or 4 televisions. However, with scarce resources, satisfying one want often leads to another want being sacrificed, or taken away. Each want an have a cost applied, which is opportunity cost. In this case, if the producer chose to manufacturing 10 smartphones, the profit of producing 4 televisions is the opportunity cost. In order to increase the production possibility for these choice by 50% (15 smartphones or 6 televisions), the production possibility frontier should</p>
<p>expand.</p>

<p>（Graph 1）</p>
<p>There are some ways to expand the ppf:</p>
<p>1.capital investment</p>
<p>2.increasing workforce</p>
<p>3.automation</p>
<p>4.improving workforce skills</p>

<p>（Graph 2）</p>
<p>【Comments】 </p>
<p>Content </p>
<p>• The homework considers many of the key elements concerning production possibility and suggestions on how to increase production, with some useful diagrams. </p>
<p>• The homework should have been provided as an essay, to enable the discussion elements to be properly considered. </p>
<p>• Overall the essay would probably be given a Low Pass. </p>
<p>Academic Writing </p>
<p>• The homework was provided as detailed notes. There is no structure to the essay, showing clearly defined introduction, body and conclusions. </p>
<p>• Need to include Your name, Topic discussed, and Submission date on every page. When given a choice of topics, it is always useful to include the relevant </p>
<p>homework title before the start of the essay.</p>
<p>• There were no citations in the homework. All key points, or potentially</p>
<p>controversial statements, theories, statistics, and descriptions should be </p>
<p>supported by references. </p>
<p>More detailed comments have been shown in the essay below [In Blue] </p>
<p>•[A brief introduction providing a summary of the question would have been useful.]</p>
<p>•[The diagram should have a title. It should also be introduced and explained in the essay itself. It would also be useful to explain the PPC and the boundaries it defines.]</p>
<p>•[It would also be useful to include a short discussion explaining that production to the right of the curve is currently impossible. Also that the electronics firm can produce any combination within the curve. But as production moves further to the left of the curve it becomes increasingly inefficient.]</p>
<p>•[It may be good to indicate that capital investment can provide machinery, research, </p>
<p>computers etc. to enable automation which can increase production.] </p>
<p>•[It may also be useful to explain that some of these may be introduced by the company, </p>
<p>the workforce or the government.] </p>
<p>•[Need to explain how each of the factors of production can be achieved and used to improve production.] </p>
<p>•[It would also be useful to include a discussion on economies of scale and how they </p>
<p>can improve production.] </p>
<p>•[No conclusions] </p>
<p>• [No citations or references] </p>

            <p>My biggest academic achievement.</p>
<p>Since I am still in high school I have not had the opportunity to achieve much academically. If I had to say, my biggest academic achievement so far would be the 45th place in the world in Fermat Contest in the first year of high school.</p>
<p> I did not actually take part in many of these international mathematic competitions in high school. I took part in Fermat Contest and Euclid Contest, but I did not do well in Euclid Contest at that time. I wanted to take the contest again this year, but due to covid-19, all the international mathematic contests cancelled the testing center in our school. So my ranking in the Fermat Contest was probably my biggest academic achievement.</p>
<p>Before the contest, I did not do a lot of preparation, and to be honest, I did not know how to prepare because that was the first time I had taken part in such a contest. I just did several past papers that the teacher gave us as to a practice. Although it is said that the content of Fermat Contest is relatively basic compared to that of Euclid Contest, I still found that I could not answer all the questions correctly and quickly when I was practicing by myself.</p>
<p>In fact, I was quite nervous at the beginning of the real contest which made me feel as if I could not answer many questions (but later I relaxed and worked on them). And I remembered very clearly that the time was very tight and there were some difficult questions that were worth very high marks at the end of the paper, which made me panic. Fortunately, all of the questions were multiple choice questions, and sometimes I was able to compare the choices one by one to the question and try to get the right answer.</p>
<p>There was a long gap between the results and the end of the contest. On the day that the ranking was revealed, one of my friends saw the ranking first She came over and told us that I had got first place in the school. I was really surprised and delighted and I was even happier when I learned my global rankings. Later our school put the grades and rankings of all the students who got good grades onto our school’s Official Account in WeChat.</p>
<p>I think that achievement, may not only help me when I apply to university in the future, it has made me more confident in myself and more interested in mathematics.</p>

<p>3 ways to make a company’s product competitive</p>
<p>According to the business life cycle,a company that has gone through the stage of establishment, growth and maturity ,in the stage of  post-maturity, it will face three different situations, renewal, steady state or decline in performance.In order to avoid the serious consequences of the companies’ declining performance, bankruptcy and takeover, the company must take some measures to make its products more competitive.<br>In the following article, I will mention three ways to make a companies’ products more competitive and why these methods are important.</p>
<p>The first method is to build customer loyalty to the brand ,and<br>building customer loyalty has many  subdivisions.To improve customer loyalty, the company can cultivate customer dependence through more communication with customers and show the customers that the company is considerate of them.At the same time, satisfaction and loyalty are always in direct proportion, so the company should improve the quality of products, to a greater extent to satisfy customers, so as the customers will make the next purchase.<br>Customers loyalty is necessary because<br>with a certain amount of customer loyalty, customers will give priority to the company they once bought products from when choosing new products.</p>
<p>The second method is to attract investment partners, or to sell some of the shares.Getting an investment partner and selling a stake means the company has more free money to spend on its operations.<br>In January 2017, McDonald’s business in the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong was acquired by a new company which is invested by  CITIC Group, CITIC Capital and Carlyle Group for 20.8 billion dollar. CITIC Group and CITIC<br>Capital<br>together have  51％ of the share in the new company and Carlyle group has 28% of the share in the new company.【paraphrased<br>from sina financial news report<br>20170110】In the past three years, McDonald’s has opened more than 1,000 stores in mainland China and Hong Kong after being acquired by a Chinese company,<br>both revenue and earnings have increased substantially.【paraphrased from the<br>announcement of CITIC Group<br>20200303】Finding a  partner or saling equity is important because they are the quickest  and the most effective way to generate high corporate returns in short period, which  works well when companies are desperate for money to compete.</p>
<p>The last method is to make innovations that appeal to consumers.<br>As mentioned before, McDonald’s<br>and many western fast food restaurants like McDonald’s, which have produced many new products in China that are not available in other countries<br>such as<br>rice porridge, soybean milk, Fried dough sticks and sichuan spicy hamburger.<br>Meanwhile,<br>the ingredients used to a large extent also cater more to Chinese people’s<br>tastes. They often introduce new products and new flavors<br>to keep consumers fresh as well.</p>
<p>The same went for the famous Apple Inc. In 1996, Apple Inc<br> faced a series of losses. By 1997, the company had hired jobs back, he had made some innovations, and the<br>revenue of Apple Inc  had increased significantly.（This is from a book I read<br>about Jobs, but I haven’t found the exact data here, because I haven’t found the<br>revenue of apple company before 2013, so I first take the parentheses and expand<br>it over here, and then I’ll make up the data after I find<br>it.）It’s important to keep innovating, because times are changing, technology is changing and many of the original products are not suitable for modern people, so the products have to keep up with the pace of The times in order to be more competitive.</p>
<p>To sum up, seven ways to make it more competitive. The first is to build customer trust and loyalty. The second is the collaboration and the third is multi-innovation.<br>Of course, these three methods are not the only ways to keep the compan’s income stable. In today’s pluralistic<br>and<br>competitive society, only by constantly taking different measures can the company become more competitive.</p>
